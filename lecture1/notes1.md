# Introduction

_"Go is an attempt to combine the ease of programming pf an interpreted, dynamically typed language with efficiency and safety of a statically typed, compiled language."_ -- Go FAQ


_"Cloud doesn't exist, you just rent somebody else's computer"_  :p


_"Go, also known as Golang, is a compiled programming language. It is designed to be statically typed and compiled to machine code. When you write a program in Go, you need to compile it before running it. The compilation process produces a binary executable file that can be executed directly on the target machine, making Go a compiled language rather than an interpreted one."_


1. Go is a modular language, we keep files in different folders and under different packages, but this main() function has to be under the `package main`

2. Also we import any package we use/need

3. See, when we use `Println` we prefix it with the package name that is comes from, i.e. `fmt`
