_"Go is an attempt to combine the ease of programming pf an interpreted, dynamically typed language with efficiency and safety of a statically typed, compiled language."_ -- Go FAQ

1. Go is a modular language, we keep files in different folders and under different packages, but this main() function has to be under the `package main`

2. Also we import any package we use/need

3. See, when we use `Println` we prefix it with the package name that is comes from, i.e. `fmt`
